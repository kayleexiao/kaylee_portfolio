Too often, people keep their struggles to themselves, unsure of where to turn or worried about being judged. This project creates a safe and anonymous space where users can openly share their feelings, reflect on their emotions, and find comfort in knowing that others may be going through similar experiences. By encouraging kindness, empathy, and genuine connection, PetPals aims to break down barriers around mental health and foster a supportive community where everyone feels heard, accepted, and valued."
